|--------|---------|
| [Decision Tree](https://github.com/Svetlin12/Intelligent-Systems/tree/main/Decision%20Tree) | A realization in `Java` of the `Decision Tree` using the `ID3` algorithm. The decision tree is pruned during construction using various parameters like tree depth, sample size, etc. |
| [K Means](https://github.com/Svetlin12/Intelligent-Systems/tree/main/K%20Means) | A realization in `C++` of KMeans. Both hard and soft initialization are included in the solution. |
| [LeapFrogPuzzle](https://github.com/Svetlin12/Intelligent-Systems/tree/main/LeapFrogPuzzle) | A realization of the `Leap From Puzzle` problem in `C++`. The solution is a simple dfs with backtracking. |
| [NPuzzleProblem](https://github.com/Svetlin12/Intelligent-Systems/tree/main/NPuzzleProblem) | A realization of `N Puzzle Problem` in `C++`. The solution uses `IDA* (Iterative Deepening A*)` algorithm with threshold as a limit for the search. |
| [NQueens](https://github.com/Svetlin12/Intelligent-Systems/tree/main/NQueens) | A realization of `NQueens` in `C++`. The solution uses `minConflicts` and linear initialization using the horse's movement. |
| [Naive Bayes Classifier](https://github.com/Svetlin12/Intelligent-Systems/tree/main/Naive%20Bayes%20Classifier) | A realization of `Naive Bayes Classifier` in `Java`. The solution uses `Laplace Smoothing` and logarithms for the probabilities to escape the `Zero Probability Problem`. |
| [TicTacToe](https://github.com/Svetlin12/Intelligent-Systems/tree/main/TicTacToe) | A realization of the game `Tic Tac Toe` in `C++`. The solution uses `Min-Max` algorithm for traversing through the state space and and `alpha-beta pruning` for improving the performance of the traversal. |
| [TravellingSalesman](https://github.com/Svetlin12/Intelligent-Systems/tree/main/TravellingSalesman) | A realization of the `Travelling Salesman` problem in `C++`. The solution uses `Genetic Algorithm` with one-point, two-point, partially-mapped and cyclic crossovers, switch, insert and reverse mutations and logic to stop creating new populations when a local or global extremum is reached. |
